Digilent Nexys video kit.

Oled s simple snake game.

Button : 
	bntc 	> to reset\init the display
	bntu	> move up the snake
	bntd	> move down the snake
	bntl	> move left the snake
	bntr	> move right the snake

LED(s) :
	led0	> Oled screen initialzation done
	
This is only for fun.

change the parameter "FRESH_TIME" if you feel the speed is too fast or too slow.

To start/restart the game :
	1.push bntc to init.
	2.push bntc again to start the game.

Now the game is a simple version, so there is no body collision determination, And
the snake can move opposite directions(It's funny becuz when you do the opposite move, the snake will look like a spring DU~ON~~).
